      This is the story of a Uitoto indigenous person who organized a resistance
      to rubber exploitation at the beginning of the 20th century in Casa Arana.
      Yarokamena, invokes the spiritual and cosmic forces of war, releasing its
      destructive power from its container that ends up creating a spiral of
      betrayal and death. This remarkable tale was banned by traditional
      authorities for its potential to attract young people to revolt and
      function as a stimulus to resort to witchcraft.

      "This story is told by Gerardo Sueche, councilor of the Uitoto peoples,
      going through filmic portraits of a delirious Amazon, invaded by
      technological ruins, dysfunctional antennas, ghost ships, and colonial
      ghosts housed in the oral memory of the survivors of this episode of
      exploitation and extractivism; using cinema as a new container for this
      destructive force. "
