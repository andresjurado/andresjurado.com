    text: The Rebirth of Carare is a 19 pages script for a slide shots presentation
      (diaporama) made around 1987 by the Association of Rural Workers of Carare
      (ATCC) and CELA Productions. Its fundamental purpose was to become an
      audiovisual manifesto that would allow the organization to expose the
      motivations of its conformation, the bets, and purposes of its life
      project, its future and the collective action strategies carried out until
      1987.

    text: However, the project seems to be unfinished. There is no copy of the
      slides or traces of the cassette in the archive preserved by the ATCC, and
      little or nothing is remembered of the project among the members of the
      Association. This film takes up the technical script and gives life to
      this slide show through a 16mm film as a recomposition and extension of
      this historical memory process.
