    text: 'La casa grande addresses our way of understanding the notion of
      inhabiting the planet Earth after the aerospace race and the arrival of
      man on the moon, reviewing events that occurred in Bogotá and Colombia,
      contemporary to the "liberation and circulation" of the first photographic
      image of our common home: the planet Earth.'

      This image was accompanied by many controversies and revolts that occurred
      parallel to the event; wars and invasions, displacements and migrations,
      continuation of extractive projects and reinstatement of imperial,
      colonial and death policies in rural and urban territories. Wars such as
      Vietnam or the war on drugs, which openly carried and promoted their
      racism, machismo and class problems that have since been transferred to
      the present. Neither women nor blacks were fit to go to the Moon, much
      less the poor. Subsidiary countries like Colombia had a participation
      subscribed to its agreements, its policies and the anti-communist struggle
      of the Cold War. In this delirious ocean, the record of events lets us
      spiral through our own memories and hopes of weaving a future in La casa
      grande.
