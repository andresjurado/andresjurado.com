    text: This exhibition is conceived as a succession of shots from a movie. It is
      a film settled down in space; a montage of time-images translated into the
      context of the exhibition.

    text: "In the scenes created by each artist beats a panorama. Crossed by
      memories, flows, and influences of ghosts-stars, horse-dragons,
      factory-husbands, grandmother- anarchists, body-intervals, cage-canes, and
      other visual deformations inherited from family mythologies of the rural,
      the mountains and the countryside. They summon a political fraud:
      bonfires, kitchens, bandits, tunnels, bombings, and riots, reconstructed
      by the media, transmitted by social networks, and intervened by artificial
      intelligences. Here, they are set up as sequence shots of the same
      cinematic experience at a crossroads."

    text: "I: Seven people rebel against state violence and carry out a revolution
      that lasts only one day. There are not many files on the event. Just a
      couple of photos. One and many anarchist grandmothers remember these
      stories."

    text: "II: In the countryside, a man who returns home is murdered due to
      ideological differences. His memory lurks like a mythological animal."

    text: "III: A woman marries a factory that ends up revealing a relationship
      between progress and chastity. The women workers carry out a strike. As
      part of their requests, they demand that they be allowed to wear shoes
      inside the factory, that the foremen who sexually harass them be
      dismissed, that the 12 hour working days be reduced and that they be given
      one hour for lunch."

    text: "IV: A woman distrusts sugar cane. She doesnt really know why, but she
      knows that this monoculture is a huge artificial cage."

    text: "V: A space trip of a subject fleeing war, global apartheid and slavery
      ends up being the projection of a lifeless body that travels through a
      river of memories and latent revolutions in the midst of multiple murders.
      Here, it is resolved in the figure of a modern myth of resistance to
      extractivism in the jungle."

    text: "VI: On the border, innumerable bodies pass through a territory that
      recalls the passage from life to death. But this passage is so arbitrary
      that it reminds us that the image also has borders."
  - type: textBlock
    text: "VII: A succession of filmic correspondences on the territory. Under the
      sun, only glimpses of an impossible and bizarre map of attempts to win
      gather in a story that repeats itself in each memory. The human cost of
      development, or the persistence of a degraded image of reality. It is
      through these image standards that we examine the projected remains of
      material and present territories of Tolima, Norte de Santander, Vichada,
      Chocó and others that are part of an experience of multiple limits: the
      territory of the film and that of the screen, their colonization, their
      techniques, their lives and their ways."

    text: This exhibition presents a digression from blunt, animated frames, with
      cut-out texts, titles, and subtitles that fit into the framework of a
      mountain of memories that would otherwise remain unregistered, untraced,
      unrelated, and without aspect. Just like many minimal revolutions that
      continue to develop day by day when walking territories that have been
      measured, tracked, controlled, and occupied.

    text: The narratives that are framed are the remnant of a trauma. They are not
      assuring or reporting the facts with fidelity, loyalty, or correctness.
      They are opening a way to consider present actions or feel the repetition
      and the archetype of the drama that is framed on the screens. Something
      that, in advance and in a material way, affects all images made by
      technical means or transmitted by them, whether in film, video,
      photography or painting. Any plane that has been concerned with portraying
      a territory according to this general digitalisation process has had to
      face, consciously or unconsciously, the Aspect Ratio. A technical term
      that here, at least, becomes manifest and, at the same time, political.
